Welcome to the **Project Pokéxe** web! First of all, thanks for showing your interest in the project.

Pokédex created with PokeAPI ([pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co)) that basically shows stats for each Pokémon, provides evolutive chain information, Pokémon forms, stats, abilities, types, etc.

Please note that **this is an _open source_ repository**, which means that anyone can donwload it, change it and push changes.
I have a list of To Do's, but I would like to complete it by myself. I basically decided to make it public
because anyone interested in making changes or downloading the project should be able to. **Please _DO NOT_ commit your changes to this project**.
